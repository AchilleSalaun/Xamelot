# Welcome to Xamelot
## A library about eXplAinable MachinE Learning for Organ Transplant

The disparity between the size of the waiting list and the availability of donor kidneys means that clinicians often consider organs from suboptimal donors for transplantation. Such decisions can be challenging, and no decision support tools are currently available to help support clinicians and patients.
Therefore, this project aims to create a clinical decision support tool that will help a clinician and patient make a personalised decision about a given organ offer. Notably, a suite of interpretable algorithms will be developed to predict post-transplant graft and patient survival, as well as patient outcomes if an organ offer is declined.

_Please note that this work is exploratory._

## Installation

Once this repository has been cloned, you can then install **Xamelot** with the following command line:

`pip3 install --upgrade --force-reinstall THE_APPROPRIATE_PATH/xmlot`

You can finally test your installation with:

`pytest THE_APPROPRIATE_PATH/xmlot`

This functionality is quite handy to check that nothing is broken if you brought any local change to the library.
