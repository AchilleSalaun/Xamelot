# Explainable machine learning models for clinical decision support in kidney transplant offering:

The disparity between the size of the waiting list and the availability of donor kidneys means that clinicians often consider organs from suboptimal donors for transplantation. Such decisions can be challenging, and no decision support tools are currently available to help support clinicians and patients.
Therefore, this project aims to create a clinical decision support tool that will help a clinician and patient make a personalised decision about a given organ offer. Notably, a suite of interpretable algorithms will be developed to predict post-transplant graft and patient survival, as well as patient outcomes if an organ offer is declined.
